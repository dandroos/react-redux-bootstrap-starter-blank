# React | Redux | Bootstrap Starter (Blank)
This is a boilerplate to get you up and running quickly, so you can spend less time faffing and more time creating!
## Get started!
```
git clone https://github.com/dandroos/react-redux-bootstrap-starter.git
```  
## What's included?
It is a create-react-app install that I have cleaned up (removed React comments and removed unneccesary - *(for me, anyway!)* - features, such as the ServiceWorker.)

It comes with the following NPM packages built-in...

+ [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) ([redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) and [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk))
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) ([bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap), [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), and [popper.js](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js))
+ [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) ([react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring))

## Cool! Anything else?
Yes, my friend! I have also set up the sass development environment as well*. It imports all of Bootstrap's components separately, so you can comment out the ones you don't need.  Take a look at the app.scss file in the src directory.  Just run `npm start` and it'll automatically watch for changes in that sass file and compile them.

*Please make sure you have [*node-sass*](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) installed globally to take advantage of this.

## Great!  What?....more?!
Absolutely!  It also comes with Redux directory/file structure all set up for you.  There is an example action and reducer to get you started in case you are a little rusty or a newcomer!

## Is there a boilerplate with starter content?
Yes.  [This way](https://github.com/dandroos/react-redux-bootstrap-starter), mi amigo.

## When should I use this starter?
I would suggest using this for a single page app or a landing page/portfolio site.
